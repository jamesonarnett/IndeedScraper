# Indeed Web Scraper

Curious about starting a new project... 
Essentially, it would automate the process of applying for jobs on Indeed and maybe other job boards as well. 
User types in their information/CV, one last time, and then picks out keywords. When the scraper hits those key words, it applies for that job. 
Rinse and Repeat.
